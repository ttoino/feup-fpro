# Rotating

Write a Python function `rotate_list(l)` that, given a list `l` of length >= 3, shifts its elements to the left 3 times, returning the new list. If an element is at the beginning, it should circle back to the end.


* for the list `l=[1,2,3,4,5,6]`, the result is the list `[4,5,6,1,2,3]`
* for the list `l=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]`, the result is the list `[4,5,6,7,8,1,2,3]`
