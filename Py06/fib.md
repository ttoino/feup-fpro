# Fibonacci numbers

Write a Python function `fib(n)` that returns a list of the first `n` [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). The next number in a Fibonacci sequence is defined as the sum of the previous two numbers, and the first two numbers are defined as 0 and 1, respectively.


* `fib(1)` should return the list: `[0]`
* `fib(5)` should return the list: `[0, 1, 1, 2, 3]`
