# N-th lowest

Write a Python function `nth_lowest(lnum, n)` that, given a list of numbers `lnum` and a positive integer `n`, returns the `n`-th lowest value in the list. Assume `n` always holds a valid value (i.e. does not include a number less or equal to one) and that the list never has repeated values.


* for the list `lnum=[42, 234, 135, 21, 232, 12312, -2343]` and `n=2`, the result is the number `21`
* for the list `lnum=[73,100,23,18,84,61,56,75,92,38,54,73,3,13]` and `n=12`, the result is the number `84`
