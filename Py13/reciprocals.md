# Reciprocals

Write a Python function `reciprocals(alist)` that, given `alist`, returns another list with the integers that are the reciprocals of the integers of the given list. The reciprocal of the number `n` is computed as `1/n`. The function catches the exceptions to continue doing the reciprocals, as possible.
