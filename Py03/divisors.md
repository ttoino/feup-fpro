# Divisors

Write a Python program that given a positive integer `num`, provided by the user, prints the sum of all its divisors.


A divisor of an integer number **n** is a number that divides **n** without the remainder.


For example:


* for `num=35` the output is `48` (1+5+7+35)
* for `num=27` the output is `40` (1+3+9+27)
* for `num=23` the output is `24` (1+23)
