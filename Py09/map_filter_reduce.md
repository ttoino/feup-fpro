# Map, Filter & Reduce

Write a function `map_filter_reduce(lst, f1, f2, f3)` that receives a list `lst` and three functions: `f1`, `f2` and `f3`. The function filters the elements of `lst` using `f1`, applies `f2` to each element of the result, and finally applies `reduce()` to convert the list to a scalar by using `f3`.
