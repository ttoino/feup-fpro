# Easy change

You're helping a teller decide how to give change. Write a Python script that given the `price` of the sale and the amount `received` by user input, then prints a string indicating how many notes of each amount they have to give as change. Consider that the **largest note** available is the **50€ note** and that all prices and amounts received are **multiples of 5** (no coins!). 


The result should be a string with the number of notes of each amount, separated by a space: "#50 #20 #10 #5".


*Hint:* To help format the result, use type conversions to string.
