# Trip Cost

You are budgeting for a car trip and need to know how much you will spend on fuel. Write a Python program that receives three inputs: the distance to travel (integer), the number of litres of fuel needed to travel 100 km (float), and the price per litre of fuel (float), then prints the total cost of fuel for the trip. Use `round` with 2 decimal places.


**Hint:** to read a float input, use `float(input())`.
