# Lost Connection

Two people go to a forest to explore the region.


In order to cover more area, they decide to take two different directions and will communicate via Walkie Talkies.


The Walkie Talkies they brought can operate up to 35 km. Once that limit is surpassed the connection is broken.


Given the direction of each explorer, define a function: `time_until_lost_connection(direction_A, direction_B)` to find the time in minutes that takes the connection between the explorers to be broken. Both explorers walk at 5 km/h in a straight line.


The directions are given in degrees, ranging from 0 to 359, counting counter-clockwise. Assume that at the start, both explorers are at the same place. Round your result to 3 decimal places using the function `round`.



```
import math
def time_until_lost_connection(direction_A, direction_B):
    # my code here
    return # FIXME

```

The function `abs(x)` can be used to get the absolute value of a number. All trigonometric functions and constants can be obtained in the `math` module. For example:


* `cos_x = math.cos(x) # x in radians`
* `pi = math.pi # pi constant`
